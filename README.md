# Mocksie

Mocksie is a no-framework, mocking framework for the Go programming language.

Mocksie will generate mocks for your Golang interfaces that don't require additional mocking or test packages. This allows you to:

1. Define mock behavior directly in the test case.
2. Avoid the need for boilerplate mocks.
3. Does not require knowledge of an additional mocking framework.
